## Tell me about yourself

- I'm Alex, I am a 2nd year student at Queen's University studying Applied Math and Computer Engineering
- Grammy award gave me resilience, drive, and shows commitment at a young age
- I take this work ethic to university, where I aim to study and get involved beyond my curriculum
- I've researched AI applications for our school's AI club and performed novel research on language models in a research program

	- Understanding the problem is halfway to the solution. This means that a well defined problem takes time and is necessary

	- I love surrounding myself with smarter people, in which I can learn from every day and fulfill lifelong learning

## Weaknesses

### False Imposter Syndrome

- I used to think I had a lot of imposter syndrome when facing new situations such as joining an AI research program or working my first professional job.
- I felt this way because I was oftentimes the youngest in the group with the least experience
- I realized that being proactive in asking questions and being resourceful when topics are not clear is enough help me break from this imposter syndrome
- At the end of the day, I think feeling imposter syndrome is a good sign and breaking free from this thought is even more important

### Tolerating Uncertainty

* In my entire life up until university, I was always certain on how my day was going to be fulfilled and what my near future looked like
* I am now in a period of life where:
	* my near future is unpredictable because my career is starting and my interests lie in ever-changing fields
	* my long-term future is now heavily considered, which will always be uncertain
* Falling under a bad habit of Preparation Trap or Analysis Paralysis will halt progress
* I have now taken the habit of:
	* If I am preparing, doing step 1 right away is required
	* If the first steps of my work are trivial, complete them then start planning if I feel disorganized
	* Take things slower and accept uncertainty as part of the journey


## Stories

### Founding a Music Production Business

Situation: Started a music production business from scratch, on my own.

Task: As I grew, I found ways to collaborate with a client base and other creators.

Action: I started growing on social media platforms, networking via Instagram and email campaigns, and making content on YouTube. With no help from my parents, I took the initiative in understand the market and niches within in and leverage my emphasis on creativity and diverse music genres to stand out. Arguably the greatest leap I took in my music career was when I started advocating for myself and affirming my value while constantly networking and sending out email campaigns to email lists.

Result: Attracted a client base in which I engaged with deals or exclusive services, made strong connections with top-tier producers and artists, and collaborated with friends to drive growth and revenue.

### Government Internship

Situation: I was assigned to a project to vectorize data and build a chatbot around this collected data. I was to work amongst 3 other colleagues.

Task: I felt a bit of imposter syndrome as this was my first professional project. I was not familiar with many of the tools and techniques necessary to accomplish this project.

Action: Stayed vocal and transparent with the group. Started meeting more frequently to provide myself with more time to ask questions. Completed tasks based my strengths and weaknesses.

Result: I made a significant impact to the project by handling the entire database of the chatbot. The product was successfully prototyped and approved by senior leadership.

### Algoverse AI Research

**Situation:** I joined an AI research team to do novel research on language models. This was my first novel research experience

**Task:** We were doing incremental contributions to an existing model framework (MoE). I was unfamiliar with language model research and doing professional research entirely. I had a minimal background in understanding the architecture of language models

**Action:** Being proactive in asking questions and being resourceful when topics are not clear is enough help me break from this imposter syndrome

**Result:**

HINTS ON HOW TO PREPARE FOR HIREVUE INTERVIEWS 
- Practice talking into a camera. It feels very strange at first to talk to a screen rather than a person. 
- Act natural, talk slowly! 
- For the "why XYZ bank": Know specifics about the bank. Try to talk to people there, integrate their answers in your response (don't just say "culture" or easily Google-able deals they were recently in as reasons to work there)
- Always try to give structured, concise responses. At the end, be sure to connect the experience with why you would be successful on the job. 
- f there is a feature where you can get rid of the picture of yourself on the screen, it makes it easier to look directly into the camera. 
- Some banks give you the chance to re-record your answer to the same question multiple times. I recommend doing this to cut down your verbal “tics” (“umm”, and “like”) and long pauses and to deliver a more concise and confident answer.
